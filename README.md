The goal with this dataset is to use topic modeling in and some text mining to break down the description and identify the genres/tags of each video. After that is done, it will become easier to identify which genres end up on the trending page of YouTube more often then others. This will hopefully help content creators on the platform decide which type of videos they should focus more on to get the best outcomes.

The excel file for the dataset is too big and will not allow me to put on here.
